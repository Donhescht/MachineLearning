Coursera Machine Learning Course Project

This project creates a paper that describes the author's approach to designing a 99% accurate model 
for predicting curl exercise type as defined in the paper "Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises".  
This activity's data was captured by sampling 6 lifters with 4 attached sensors.  
These sensors were attached to the lifter's forearm, arm, belt and dumbbell.  They were then monitored while 
performing 5 distinct curl exercises: one that was "correct" and four others 
with distinct errors.  The aggregate of these sensor data and post calculations resulted 
in 19622 observations of 160 variables.
